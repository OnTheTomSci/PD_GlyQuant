Pesudeo glycomics is glycomic like analysis from glycoproteomics data. unlike true glycomics data we
can not get the glycan structural feaures such as where a glycan is core or antenna fucosylation from 
the glycoproteomics data. therefore we use the glycan composition to represent the glycan profile. 
one application of pesudo glycomics is to compare the glycan composition to the true glycomics data 
if it has beencollected to validate glycoproteomics data before further analysis. 

pesudo glycomics can also be used in place tradional glycomics methods such as pgc or 
permethylated glycomics, in labs where these methods are not available or expertise is in glycomics 
is limited. thus the pesudo glycomics can serve as a precursor to more detailed glycomics analysis 
without any need specialised equipment apar from  widley addopted MS/MS proteomics equipment.
